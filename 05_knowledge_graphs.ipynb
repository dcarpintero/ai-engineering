    "Knowledge Graphs, a form of graph-based knowledge representation, provide a method for modeling and storing interlinked information in a format that is both human- and machine-understandable. These graphs consist of *nodes* and *edges*, representing entities and their relationships. Unlike traditional databases, the inherent expressiveness of graphs allows for richer semantic understanding, while providing the flexibility to accommodate new entity types and relationships without being constrained by a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining knowledge graphs with embeddings (vector search), we can leverage *multi-hop connectivity* and *contextual understanding of information* to enhance querying, reasoning, and explainability in LLMs. This notebook explores the practical implementation of this approach, demonstrating how to (i) build a knowledge graph of academic publications, and (ii) extract actionable insights from it."
